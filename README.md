This code implements a simple console-based ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation in Java. It allows a user to:

Log in using a customer number and PIN

Choose between a checking or saving account

View balance, deposit money, or withdraw money

Exit the program

# Why This Code is Used: 

This code serves as a learning project to understand,

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

Class and method organization

User input/output handling

Basic banking simulation logic

Use of HashMap, Scanner, DecimalFormat, etc.

# For Example:

Suppose user logs in with,

Customer Number: 952141
PIN: 191904

Then,

Chooses “Checking Account”

Selects “Deposit Funds” and enters $500

Then selects “View Balance” → Sees $500
